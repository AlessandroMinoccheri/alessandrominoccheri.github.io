      <description>Symfony 4 is the newest version of the one of the most famous php frameworks. It has been released on the 30th of November 2017 and it&amp;rsquo;s having a great success! One of the biggest difference with the older versions is the presence of very small dependencies installed when you init your Symfony 4 project. The framework is so tiny that the Silex project has been dismissed because as it was a little version of the framework in Symfony 4 now it&amp;rsquo;s even smaller so you don&amp;rsquo;t need it.</description>
